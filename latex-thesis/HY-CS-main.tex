%% REFERENCES
%% Some notes on bibliography usage and options:
%% natbib -> you can use, e.g., \citep{} or \parencite{} for (Einstein, 1905); with APA \cite -> Einstein, 1905 without ()
%% maxcitenames=2 -> only 2 author names in text citations, if more -> et al. is used
%% maxbibnames=99 as no great need to suppress the biliography list in a thesis
%% for more information see biblatex package documentation, e.g., from https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex

%% Reference style: select one
%% for APA = Harvard style = authoryear -> (Einstein, 1905) use:
% \usepackage[style=authoryear,bibstyle=authoryear,backend=biber,natbib=true,maxnames=99,maxcitenames=2,uniquelist=minyear,giveninits=true,uniquename=mininit]{biblatex}
%% for numeric = Vancouver style -> [1] use:
\usepackage[style=numeric,bibstyle=numeric,backend=biber,natbib=true,maxbibnames=99,giveninits=true,uniquename=init]{biblatex}
%% for alpahbetic -> [Ein05] use:
%\usepackage[style=alphabetic,bibstyle=alphabetic,backend=biber,natbib=true,maxbibnames=99,giveninits=true,uniquename=init]{biblatex}
%

\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}
% in case you want the final delimiter between authors & -> (Einstein & Zweistein, 1905)
% \renewcommand{\finalnamedelim}{ \& }
% List the authors in the Bibilipgraphy as Lastname F, Familyname G,
\DeclareNameAlias{sortname}{family-given}
% remove the punctuation between author names in Bibliography
%\renewcommand{\revsdnamepunct}{ }

% Asked chat.openai.com: I'm using biblatex package, but it prints odd format volume.number in reference list, while this should be volume (number). How to fix this?
%Answer (shortened):
% Redefine the volume and number format
%\DeclareFieldFormat[article]{volume}{\mkbibbold{#1}}
%\DeclareFieldFormat[article]{number}{\mkbibparens{#1}}
% Please remove the boldface from the volume and number fields:
\DeclareFieldFormat[article]{volume}{#1}
\DeclareFieldFormat[article]{number}{\mkbibparens{#1}}
% Now this generated format volume.(number). How to remove the dot? (and so on with some adjustments):
\renewbibmacro*{volume+number+eid}{%
  \setunit{\addcomma\space}%
  \printfield{volume}%
  %\setunit*{\addnbspace\addthinspace}% <-- Adjust spacing here
  \printfield{number}%
  \setunit{\addcomma\space}%
  \printfield{eid}}

% Finally, specify 1--3 ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) topics, as per \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs}.
% Each topic is specified with one path, as shown in the example below, and elements of the path separated with an arrow.
% Emphasis of each element individually can be indicated
% by the use of bold face for high importance or italics for intermediate level.

%% Write your abstract in the separate file, to be positioned here.
%% You can make several abstract pages (if you want it in different languages),
%% in which case you should also define the language of the abstract,
%% as below.

\include{Ch.05_Lyhennelma}

% Place ToC
%\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% STEP 4: Write the thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Your actual text starts here. You shouldn't mess with the code above the line except
%% to change the parameters. Removing the abstract and ToC commands will mess up stuff.
%%
%% Command \include{file} includes the file of name file.tex.
%% A new page will be created at every \include command,
%% which makes it appropriate to use it for large entities such as book chapters. Cannot be nested.
%% It is useful for a big project, as changing one of the include targets
%% won't force the regeneration of the outputs of all the rest.
%% Alternatively, \input is a more lower level macro
%% which simply inputs the content of the given file like it was copy&pasted there manually.
