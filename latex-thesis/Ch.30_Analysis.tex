"observations"
- Tale of two type systems and TODO reported a high proportion of the used dataset not type checking. (Todo check) They did not report which settings they used when running MyPy and PyType, and it is plausible that they did not configure the type checker version and settings for each source code repository separately. This could cause false false positives, eg errors that do not appear in the repository with correct checker settings. This can also cause errors to appear that are not visible to the project developers, due to being added in a later type checker version than the one they use.
