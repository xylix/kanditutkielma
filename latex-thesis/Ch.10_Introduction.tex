Python is a general-purpose dynamically typed programming language. It has been growing fast in popularity since early 2010s.

In general dynamic programming languages have been gaining market share. In certain problems dynamic languages provide rapid prototyping capabilities and work better for newcomers. % An Empirical Comparison of Seven Programming Languages (Koitin kaivaa, niiden alkuperäislähde tolle on heikko / statee että tulokset ei yleistyisi...)

In 2014 Python introduced PEP-484 to support type annotations, also known as type hints. \cite{pep_484} The solution specifies that by default the annotations will be available at runtime. It does not specify a way to utilize them. Various type checkers have been developed. %citation needed

These type checkers provide ways to statically analyse Python source code to find type errors. Type errors can help developers find and possibly fix software defects. \cite{khan_empirical_2022} 

This paper provides an overview of ways that Python source code can be type annotated and type checked. Then we investigate the costs and benefits of type annotating Python.
